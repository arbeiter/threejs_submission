[lavf] This format is marked by FFmpeg as having no timestamps!
[lavf] FFmpeg will likely make up its own broken timestamps. For
[lavf] video streams you can correct this with:
[lavf]     --no-correct-pts --container-fps-override=VALUE
[lavf] with VALUE being the real framerate of the stream. You can
[lavf] expect seeking and buffering estimation to be generally
[lavf] broken as well.
‚óè Video  --vid=1  (mpeg2video 1920x1080 25 fps)
Container FPS forced to 60.000.
Use --no-correct-pts to force FPS based timing.
