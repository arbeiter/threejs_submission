# Three.js Journey

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

### IMPORTANT

This process could be scripted but I did not get the time to finish this.
Add blender_export.py to your blender file to produce a glb file
Then import it into the static directory as "output.glb"
